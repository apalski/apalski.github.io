Each time I finish and submit a lab I check the provided solution to see how I went and what I can improve on.

Initially, I would be despondent if I didn't get the same code as the solution. Yes I had solved the lab but I wanted to have the same precise, crisp code of the solution. As I have progressed through the course I have realised that the type of coding in the solutions comes from experience and practice. Moreover, I have realised that the coding in the solutions is also done by a variety of coders and each of these coders has their own style. It is ok for my coding not to be the same as another person's code as long as I have made it as concise and correct as my experience allows. The key is to be open to improving my code as I learn more.

Another thing I have learnt is that the code provided in the solutions is not the only way to solve the lab. It is also not the only way to set out the project folders and inclusions. Some solutions use an environment file and some don't. Some solutions use modules and some don't. 

I now try to think about what makes the most sense. How will someone working on my code in the future understand the way I have set things out. I try to understand the conventions of the language I am working in and ensure I work within them. Am I ensuring that I have 'idiot-proofed' my code and setup. Have I ensured there are no ambiguities in my code and setup. My goal is to create easily understood code that is extendable. I take the time to include sufficient comments for every part of my code and make several reviews of my code to see where I can tighten and improve it.
