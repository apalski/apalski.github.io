Ok, so I need to learn to talk about coding. So said Avi this morning during my Orientation session. So I guess I need to talk about coding until I am fluent.

I am working on HTML and CSS at the moment and I am finding the sheer volume of information to remember mind boggling. It is unlike any coding that I have done before and I have found it very challenging. But I am learning it day by day and I am actually remembering most of it and if I don’t  remember exactly I am at least remembering a clue to follow to find the information I need.

The most interesting thing I have learnt so far is creating a responsive layout using media queries. I can’t imagine why you would create a website any other way. It is fascinating to watch the page restructure itself as you change the screen size up and down. Sometimes all it takes is one small change and you see a huge difference.

Something as simple as having a page set to three columns for an article as the default and then as the screen width reduces having the article move down a column until you are left with only one column at the smallest screen width. To do this you use a media query which creates a break point at a specified screen width, say 750px, and you set column-count to two instead of the defaut of three. Then you have a second media query creating a second break point, say 450px, and the column-count set to one.

The little things that you learn during the lessons are huge bonuses:
•	Using the Digital Color Monitor app on my Mac to pick up the colors used in a website; such a simple trick;
•	Opening up development tools in your browser and then being able to see the screen resolution in the top right corner as you adjust the screen height and width. This makes finding the required break points for the media queries so easy as you watch what happens to your web page at different screen widths;
•	The great shortcuts that you use in Sublime Text to make life easier – as an example simply type ‘a’ and hit the tab key and you have ‘<a href=""></a>’ instantly displayed – just fill in the blanks; so easy.

So the coding conversation has begun with this blog and will continue in every way I can find even if it is talking to my cats about coding! If one day you hear about amazing software developments by a cat, it will be one of my boys.
