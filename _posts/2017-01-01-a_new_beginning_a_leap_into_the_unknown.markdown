What better day to start a new blog than New Year’s Day. A day where we make resolutions for the new year ahead and look forward to a new start. A day of reflection where we look back over past years and think about what we could have done differently and what we still have to achieve.

This year is set to be amazing as I begin my journey into web development. I am both excited and a little nervous; I have quit my job and taken a leap of faith into the unknown. 

I have arrived at this point knowing I need to make changes to fully live my life and enjoy each day. My careers to date have been about necessity not fulfilment. Now I look ahead knowing that my work life will be totally about me; what I want in life and what I want to achieve. 

Web development is a natural step for me; I love to solve problems and I’m always thinking laterally to look for the better, and often less obvious, solutions. I see myself working for organisations such as Animals Australia or Greenpeace, assisting them to create positive change in the world. There are so many new apps that can be developed to allow people to easily make ethical choices; free range eggs that are legitimately free range or clothing that does not imvolve child labour. While I don't yet have the skills to develop the apps it is great to start to plan and dream of future projects.

What an exciting time to enter the IT world. There is so much going on with the Internet of Things, cloud computing, virtual reality, AI, apps for everything, life at our fingertips.

I get to be a part of this as I learn the fundamentals of web development. Within the year I will be working in an industry that will literally change the future and be limited only by our ability to think of new things. As I build my arsenal of tech tools I will also build my arsenal of ideas and dreams and immerse myself in this exciting world of fast paced change.
