Coding meetups can be amazing but they can also be daunting for a newbie. 

I have now attended two coding meetups and they were very different from each other. I had never attended any form of meetup before so I didn't know what to expect. It seems there are various styles of meetups, some are workshops and some have formal talks and I am sure there are other types I am yet to attend.

The first one was pretty cruisy, a RubyOnRails workshop style meetup, just a group of coders with their laptops doing their own thing with mentor support. I found a spot to sit, opened up my laptop and carried on with a project I was working on. I got to work with one of the mentors which was a real insight into how much I have to learn. There was pizza and beer and a very relaxed atmosphere.

The second one was a HTML/CSS meetup that started with me feeling way out of my depth and wondering what I was doing there. It was at an amazing venue with waiters for your drinks and plates and plates of upmarket food. It was a finely tuned event with a schedule of talks and question time.The night began with mingling and small groups began to form and the only person I knew was one of the organisers, and she was busy getting things under way. I grabbed a drink and some food and took a deep breath and introduced myself to a few people all of whom had been in IT for more than a decade. Despite not understanding some of the conversations it was great to connect with people already working where I ultimately want to be.The two talks were really interesting and I actually understood some of the content while taking in other things for later googling. At the end of the evening a number of employers came forward and spoke briefly about employment opportunites they had; something to look forward to down the track when I am ready to dive in.

I have decided I will attend both of these meetups again, and probably others, and give myself time to assmilate into these new worlds. It will be awkward and hard but I have so much to learn from the people I am meeting.
